# PY-71091 Examples

This document provides examples relating to the issue PY-71091, including scenarios where an Artificial Intelligence (AI) tool understands or fails to understand the context.

## Understanding Context with AI

When using the `Explain with AI` feature, the AI tool is capable of understanding the context effectively. It provides appropriate and relevant recommendations based on the existing program context.

## Manual Copy-Pasting and Context Misunderstanding

In contrast, when manual copy-pasting is involved in explaining the problem to the AI tool, it often fails to correctly understand the context. The AI tool only understands the complete context when explicitly informed to consider the entire program.

## Absence of 'Explain with AI' for Syntax and Indentation Errors

It is noted that no `Explain with AI` button is available when encountering `SyntaxError` and `IndentationError`. This limitation reduces the effectiveness of debugging assistance for these common categories of errors.
